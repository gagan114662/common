This is a highly ambitious project. Achieving a 25% CAGR with a Sharpe ratio above 1 and a maximum drawdown below 15% consistently across multiple asset classes is exceptionally difficult, even for sophisticated systems.  The proposed architecture is a good starting point, but significant optimization is required across all tiers.  Let's address each question:


**1. Architecture Optimization:**

The current 3-tier architecture is reasonable, but could benefit from:

* **Parallel Processing:** Implement true parallelism at all tiers.  The strategy generation and backtesting phases are prime candidates for multiprocessing or multithreading using Python's `multiprocessing` module or libraries like `concurrent.futures`.  Distribute the workload across multiple CPU cores.

* **Asynchronous Operations:** Use asynchronous programming (e.g., `asyncio`) to handle I/O-bound operations (data fetching, API calls) concurrently without blocking the main thread. This is crucial for achieving the API response time target.

* **Microservices Architecture:** Consider breaking down Tier 2 (Strategy Generation & Testing) and Tier 3 (Evolution Systems) into independent microservices. This improves scalability, fault tolerance, and allows for independent scaling of different components.  Each agent could be a separate microservice.

* **Message Queue:** Introduce a message queue (e.g., RabbitMQ, Redis) to facilitate communication between tiers and agents. This decouples components, allowing for asynchronous processing and improved robustness.


**2. Strategy Generation:**

Generating 100+ quality strategies per hour requires a sophisticated approach:

* **Template-Based Generation:**  Instead of generating entirely random strategies, use a set of pre-defined templates (e.g., moving average crossovers, RSI-based strategies, etc.) with parameterized inputs.  The evolutionary algorithm would then optimize these parameters.

* **Genetic Programming:** Consider using Genetic Programming (GP) in addition to or instead of DEAP. GP allows for the evolution of the strategy's structure itself, not just its parameters, leading to more novel and potentially more profitable strategies.

* **Parameter Space Reduction:** Carefully define the parameter search space for each strategy template.  Using techniques like Bayesian Optimization can significantly reduce the number of evaluations needed to find optimal parameters.

* **Strategy Filtering:** Implement a robust filtering mechanism to eliminate obviously poor-performing strategies early in the process. This could involve simple checks (e.g., excessive transaction costs) or more sophisticated metrics (e.g., initial Sharpe ratio on a smaller dataset).


**3. Multi-Agent Coordination:**

Effective coordination is vital:

* **Shared Knowledge Base:** Implement a shared knowledge base (e.g., a database) where agents can share their findings (discovered profitable strategies, market insights).

* **Reward Sharing:** Design a reward mechanism that encourages collaboration. For example, agents could receive a bonus for contributing strategies that complement the strategies of other agents (diversification).

* **Supervisor Agent Role:** The supervisor agent should play a crucial role in resource allocation (assigning tasks to agents based on their strengths), conflict resolution (avoiding overlapping research areas), and overall performance monitoring.

* **Reinforcement Learning:** Consider using reinforcement learning techniques to train the supervisor agent to optimize the overall portfolio performance based on the actions of the individual agents.


**4. Risk Management:**

Risk management needs to be integrated at all levels:

* **Tier 1 (Execution Engine):**  Implement position sizing algorithms (e.g., Kelly Criterion, fixed fractional position sizing) and stop-loss orders.  Monitor and enforce limits on overall portfolio risk (e.g., Value at Risk - VaR).

* **Tier 2 (Strategy Generation):** Filter out strategies exhibiting high drawdown during backtesting.  Include drawdown as a fitness function in the evolutionary algorithm.

* **Tier 3 (Evolution Systems):**  Integrate risk-adjusted performance metrics (Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio) into the fitness function to penalize strategies with high risk even if they have high returns.


**5. Performance Optimization:**

Achieving the 30-minute backtesting time is challenging:

* **Data Preprocessing:** Preprocess the historical data (e.g., calculate indicators in advance) to significantly reduce computation time during backtesting. Store these preprocessed features.

* **Vectorization:** Use NumPy's vectorization capabilities extensively to perform calculations on entire datasets at once instead of iterating row-by-row.

* **Database Optimization:**  Use a fast, in-memory database (e.g., SQLite, in-memory Pandas DataFrames) to store and access backtesting data.

* **GPU Acceleration:** Explore GPU acceleration using libraries like CuPy for computationally intensive operations.

* **Parallel Backtesting:** Parallelize the backtesting process across multiple cores, dividing the time period or the strategies among them.


**6. Evolution Algorithm:**

The genetic algorithm parameters depend heavily on the problem's complexity and search space.  Experimentation is key:

* **Population Size:** Start with a relatively large population (e.g., 500-1000) to ensure diversity, but adjust based on computational resources.

* **Mutation Rate:** A moderate mutation rate (e.g., 0.1-0.2) is generally a good starting point. Too high, and you lose progress; too low, and you risk getting stuck in local optima.

* **Selection Pressure:** Start with a moderate selection pressure (e.g., tournament selection with a tournament size of 2-5).  Higher pressure can speed convergence but may lead to premature convergence.

* **Elitism:** Always retain the best individuals from one generation to the next (elitism) to prevent losing the best-performing strategies.

* **Generational vs. Steady-State:** Experiment with both generational and steady-state genetic algorithms.  Steady-state may be more efficient for this application.


**7. Real-Time Monitoring:**

The real-time monitoring system should track:

* **Portfolio Value:**  Continuous monitoring of the portfolio's value and its percentage change.

* **Drawdown:**  Real-time tracking of the maximum drawdown.  Set alerts for exceeding predefined thresholds.

* **Sharpe Ratio (rolling):**  Calculate a rolling Sharpe ratio to assess the risk-adjusted return.

* **Transaction Costs:**  Monitor the impact of transaction costs on overall portfolio performance.

* **Agent Performance:** Track each agent's contribution to the overall portfolio performance and identify underperforming agents.


**8. Scalability:**

Scalability requires a well-designed architecture:

* **Cloud Infrastructure:**  Utilize cloud computing resources (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Azure) to easily scale up or down based on demand.

* **Horizontal Scaling:** Design the system for horizontal scaling, where multiple instances of the same component can be added to handle increased workload.

* **Database Scaling:**  Use a distributed database solution (e.g., Cassandra, MongoDB) if necessary to handle the large volume of data generated.

* **Load Balancing:**  Implement load balancing to distribute the workload evenly across multiple instances of the system.


**Crucial Note:**  The ambitious performance targets are extremely difficult to achieve.  Extensive experimentation, careful parameter tuning, and robust risk management are absolutely essential.  Consider starting with a simplified version of the system (fewer agents, fewer asset classes) and gradually increasing complexity.  Regularly evaluate and refine your approach based on results.  Thorough backtesting and out-of-sample validation are critical to ensure robustness.  Expect to iterate significantly.
